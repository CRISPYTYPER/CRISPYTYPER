### Hi, thanks for coming!:grinning:
I am an undergraudate student, studying **Computer Science**.:computer:<br>
I'm currently dealing with *__WEB__* and *__CROSS-PLATFORM APP__*.<br>
For the purpose for developing *__WEB__*, I use *__Spring Framework__*!<br>
Also I am studying *__Flutter__* for the upcoming development.<br>
Moreover, studying *__Node.js__* now for fun.<br>
To be honest, I am not such an outstanding developer.<br>
But I'm *constantly* making an effort to improve myself as a developer.<br>
