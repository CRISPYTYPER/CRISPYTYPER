### Hi, thanks for visiting! ðŸ˜Š

I recently graduated with a degree in **Computer Science**. ðŸ’»  

I've dedicated myself to expanding my skills and knowledge, especially in **Java** and **Spring**.  

Now, I'm confident in my development abilities, having completed various projects and diligently engaged in coursework and lectures.  

I always strive to learn and grow, consistently pushing myself beyond my comfort zone to become a better developer and collaborator.  

I'm excited about opportunities to contribute my skills, collaborate effectively within a team, and keep growing together!  

#### Welcome, and thank you for stopping by! ðŸš€
