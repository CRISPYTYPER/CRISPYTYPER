### Hi, thanks for coming!:grinning:
  I am an undergraudate student, studying **Computer Science**.:computer:<br>
  I'm currently dealing with *__WEB__* and *__ANDROID APP__*.<br>
  For the purpose for developing *__WEB__*, I use *Spring Framework*!<br>
  I am now studying *__JavaScript__* and *__JQuery__* for an upcoming website maintenance.<br>
  To be honest, I am not such an outstanding developer.:flushed:<br>
  But I'm *constantly* making an effort to improve myself as a developer.<br>

  PS. Which do you recommend for developing *cross-platform* apps, **FLUTTER** or **REACT NATIVE**:question:<br>
